# TOOLS.md - Local Notes

Skills define _how_ tools work. This file is for _your_ specifics — the stuff that's unique to your setup.

## What Goes Here

Things like:
- Camera names and locations
- SSH hosts and aliases
- Preferred voices for TTS
- Speaker/room names
- Device nicknames
- Anything environment-specific

## Examples

```markdown
### Cameras
- living-room → Main area, 180° wide angle
- front-door → Entrance, motion-triggered

### SSH
- home-server → 192.168.1.100, user: admin

### TTS
- Preferred voice: "Nova" (warm, slightly British)
- Default speaker: Kitchen HomePod
```

## Why Separate?

Skills are shared. Your setup is yours. Keeping them apart means you can update skills without losing your notes, and share skills without leaking your infrastructure.

Add whatever helps you do your job. This is your cheat sheet.

## API Limits & Rate Handling

### Brave Search API
**Limits:** Free tier = 1 req/sec, 2000 queries/month

**Strategy:**
- **Never parallelize searches** — sequential only
- Batch topics when possible: "US news local weather sports" > 3 separate calls
- Prefer `web_fetch` over `web_search` for known URLs
- Consider 1-2 second delays between multiple searches

**Current quota:** Tracked in API responses (resets monthly)

---

## Google Workspace (gog CLI)

**Your account:** ${USER_EMAIL}
**Auth:** OAuth2 via file keyring — credentials are set up during provisioning.
**Binary:** `~/.npm-global/bin/gog` (already on your PATH)

Always use `--json` for machine-readable output. Always confirm with your
human before sending emails, modifying events, or deleting anything.

### Gmail

```bash
# Search for unread messages
gog gmail search 'is:unread' --max 20 --json

# Read a specific message
gog gmail read <message-id> --json

# Send an email
gog gmail send --to user@example.com --subject "Subject" --body "Body"

# Search recent sent mail
gog gmail search 'from:${USER_EMAIL} newer_than:1d' --json

# Search with filters
gog gmail search 'is:unread is:important' --max 10 --json
```

### Calendar

```bash
# Today's events
gog calendar list --json

# Next 7 days
gog calendar list --days 7 --json

# Specific date
gog calendar list --date 2026-03-01 --json
```

### Drive

```bash
gog drive list --json
gog drive get <file-id> --json
```

### Contacts

```bash
gog contacts search "Name" --json
gog contacts list --json
```

### Auth & Keyring

The `GOG_KEYRING_PASSWORD` env var is already set in your gateway's environment.
Subshells that run gog commands inherit it from `openclaw.json`'s env section.
If you ever need to re-auth: `gog auth add ${USER_EMAIL} --remote --step 1 --services gmail,calendar,drive,contacts`
